Application Documentation
Overview
This is a desktop application built with Electron that provides tools for testing and monitoring APIs and Kafka messaging systems. The application is designed to help developers and testers validate their services and message queues efficiently.
Core Components
1. API Tester
The API Tester is a sophisticated tool that allows users to test REST APIs with MongoDB integration. It provides a step-by-step interface for configuring and executing API tests.
Features:
Connection Configuration
MongoDB connection setup with default localhost connection
Database and collection selection
Real-time connection validation
CURL Command Builder
Dynamic base URL configuration
Support for path parameters using {paramName} syntax
Query parameter handling
Header management
Request body configuration
Request Builder
Visual interface for linking MongoDB fields to request components
Support for:
Path parameters
Query parameters
Headers
Request body
Real-time validation of field mappings
Execution Configuration
Configurable number of requests
Synchronous/Asynchronous execution options
Real-time progress monitoring
Results Dashboard
Request success rate statistics
Average response time
Detailed request logs
Error reporting
Visual status indicators
2. Kafka Tester
The Kafka Tester provides tools for testing and monitoring Kafka message queues.
Features:
Connection Management
Kafka broker configuration
Topic management
Consumer group setup
Message Testing
Message production testing
Message consumption monitoring
Message format validation
Schema validation
Monitoring
Real-time message flow visualization
Topic statistics
Consumer lag monitoring
Error tracking

Usage Guidelines
API Tester
Setting Up a Test
Configure MongoDB connection
Select database and collection
Enter base URL for API
Input CURL command with path parameters
Map MongoDB fields to request components
Configure execution parameters
Run tests and analyze results
Best Practices
Use {paramName} syntax for path parameters
Validate MongoDB field mappings before execution
Monitor response times and success rates
Review error logs for failed requests
Kafka Tester
Setting Up a Test
Configure Kafka broker connection
Select or create topics
Set up consumer groups
Configure message format
Start monitoring
Best Practices
Validate message schemas
Monitor consumer lag
Track message flow patterns
Review error logs
Error Handling
Connection errors are displayed with detailed messages
Request failures are logged with status codes and error messages
Kafka connection issues are reported with broker-specific details
Message validation errors are tracked and displayed
Security Considerations
MongoDB connection strings are handled securely
Kafka credentials are managed securely
API endpoints are validated before execution
Sensitive data in logs is properly masked
